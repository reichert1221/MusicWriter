MusicWriter
===========

Compose music on the web, easily, all inside an internet browser.


## Status: Development (v0.5.0)
The API for Music Writer is in a construction phase, the logic is under development, and rendering code is usable, but needs to be implemented into the app to be usable by the user. The end product will allow users to create music, in browser, save their creation as a JSON (or svg) file, reload to edit, and finally print.

The project uses node.js for the server environment, although the frontend logic can be use where ever, snap.svg for the rendering engine, and Angular.js for the frontend logic. This is combined with jQuery and straight javascript.


## Current Features
The Following are currently implemented into the API
- Whole, Half, Quarter, Eighth, and Double Eighth Notes
- Whole, Half, Quarter, and Eighth Rests
- Accidentals (sharps, flats, naturals)
- Dotted notes (accidentals and dotted notes are supported, but are not currently linkable to notes)
- Creating the stave (22 measures)
- - Double bar at the end
- The Control Bar
- - Ability to select a note/rest to use with sliding indicator bar
-Click to insert notes/rests
