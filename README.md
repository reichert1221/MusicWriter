MusicWriter
===========

Compose music on the web, easily, all inside an internet browser.


## Status: Development
The API for Music Writer has yet to be written as the logic and code has yet to be completed. The end product will allow users to create music, in browser, save their creation as a JSON (or svg) file, reload to edit, and finally print.

The project is built off of a node.js server and will incorporate Angular.js when the logic is closer to completion.
